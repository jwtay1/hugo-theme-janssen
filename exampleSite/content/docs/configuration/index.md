You can configure Janssen to fit your own style. To avoid conflicts with future updates, it is highly recommended that you do not modify the original theme files. Instead, create the files _with the same path_ under your site's root directory (see [here](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-override-a-themes-partials/47227)).
